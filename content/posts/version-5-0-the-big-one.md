Over the last six months, we have been working on the largest (and longest to develop) update to Mue. The v5.0 screenshot above compared to the v4.1 screenshot below shows the massive transformation that Mue has undergone.

Mue is now smaller, faster, and more beautiful, with new features and even more customisation options. Customising your Mue new tab is now even easier with the completely redesigned and logically organised options modal, which is much more user-friendly to navigate.
