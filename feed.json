We wanted something true to the Mue brand while remaining extremely fast and responsive.<br>To stick with our branding we made sure to use the exact same colours as used in our logo, the gradient and the white. Which explains most of the website design choices. Plus we stuck with the font we knew, Lexend Deca. Our favourite font, due it's simplicity and ease of access. Still keeping the main and best parts of the original, such as the demo, while giving it a better overall feel.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this update to the website.</p>",
